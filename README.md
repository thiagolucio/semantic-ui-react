# Boilerplate using ReactJS and Semantic UI (just that, clean and simple):

This project was bootstrapped with:
-  [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
-  [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/).

# To Run this Boilerplate:
### `yarn`
### `yarn start`

# Runs the app in the development mode.
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Good Look :)
